.. index:: Register

Register
========

In the case where one does not have a username or password, they will be required to first register themselves in order to have an account in the system. To do so; besides the login page, there is a register tab. On selecting it, a page similar to one shown below (Figure 1.4 below) will appear requesting the new user to fill in all required details and submit them by clicking the “Register” button. After doing so an email to activate the account will be sent to the users email account provided during registration; and the registering user will be prompted to visit their email and follow link sent for activating their account. 
These steps so far, will enable for an account to be created but access to information already in the system will still not be possible until verification of user is done by the help desk team who will then assign new user to an organization unit for complete registration.
