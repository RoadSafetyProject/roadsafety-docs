The aggregated data, in this new release gives the user more ways to explore the data that are in the system already. It allows a user to specify the organization units they want the report for, select the form in which the data will be chosen for report and then select the data to view. These data are in two fields, field one and field two. However, you can also generate this report by selecting only one field and not comparing it to any other field. To do so you have to specify field one and in field to select the option for “use only one field”. This will aggregate only data for field one selected.
